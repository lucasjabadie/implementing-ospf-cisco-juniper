# Implementing OSPF on Cisco and Juniper

In this project, we will demonstrate the deployment of OSPF and BGP routing protocols on Cisco and Juniper devices using the Eve-NG virtualization platform. Our goal is to provide a detailed guide that will guide you through each step of the process, including the setup of a virtual lab environment, configuration of OSPF and BGP protocols, and testing and verification of the configurations.

We will begin by accessing the repository for this project, which will provide instructions on how to get Juniper and Cisco images running on Eve-NG.

The second step will involve performing basic IP configuration on Cisco and Juniper devices within the virtual lab environment.

Finally, we will proceed to the configuration of OSPF on Cisco and Juniper devices, and demonstrate how to verify that the OSPF routing protocol is working as expected.
