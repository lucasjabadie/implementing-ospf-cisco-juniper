# Inter-Area Summarization

Inter-Area summarization is used to reduce the amount of routing information exchanged between OSPF areas. This helps to reduce the size of the OSPF routing table and improve the scalability of the network.

If we take a look at the  network diagram, inter-area summarization can be implemented to provide a summarized version of the routes within Area 1 to OSPF areas 0, 2, and 3, rather than transmitting the entire routing table.
